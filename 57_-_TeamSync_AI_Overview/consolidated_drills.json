Players learn to recognize transition moments, adjust their roles instantly, and execute appropriate actions based on whether they've won or lost possession. This drill creates a high-intensity environment that mirrors the demanding physical and mental requirements of modern soccer where transitions often determine match outcomes.",

The team attacking the large goal has a goalkeeper while the team attacking the small goals plays without one. When possession changes, teams must transition immediately to their new role. The team that loses possession must recover defensively while the team winning possession attacks quickly. Coach feeds new balls to maintain intensity and can award bonus points for goals scored within 5 seconds of winning possession.",
